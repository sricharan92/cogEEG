# EEG Preprocessing pipeline for CogLab

This is a repository created for EEG Preprocessing for Cognition Lab, IISc. This has been specifically created for the EGI acquisition system. We have made sure that the parameters are matched really closely across this and the BioSemi pipelines.

Please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/sricharan92/cogEEG/wiki/Getting-Started) for more details on how to use this pipeline. 

Thanks!
